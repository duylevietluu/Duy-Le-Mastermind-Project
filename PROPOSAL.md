# Project Proposal
### Due: Monday 1/3 @ 11:59pm Eastern Time

This file will contain your Final Project Proposal. Answer the prompts below to outline your project. If you are struggling to think of ideas, refer to the [Project Overview](https://cs.oberlin.edu/~cs150/final-project/part-1/) for suggestions.

### What is the title of your project?
Mastermind

### In 3-5 sentences, summarize what you want to accomplish. Provide enough detail so that I can understand your main idea, but try to keep things concise.

I want to recreate Mastermind. Here is the rule of the game:
- This game involves guessing a color sequence of length 4. 
- Players can make 10 guesses. 
- For each guess, players insert a sequence. If this sequence matches, they win the game. Otherwise, the game provide them with the number of black pegs (correct color in the right position) and white pegs (correct color in the wrong position). 
I want to this game to have a graphical interface.

### In a numbered list, briefly describe your intermediate goal(s) (i.e., what you want to accomplish before lab on January 12/13th). 
#### Note that you will reflect on how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s) in your Progress Report.
1. Create algorithm for generating the sequence.
2. Get user's input and count for black pegs and white pegs.
