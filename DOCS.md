The program is a game called Mastermind. In this game the player have to guess a color sequence of length 4 in its exact order. Player have maximum 10 guesses.

For each guess, the player edits their white line by clicking color buttons or the delete button (which clears the white line). Then submit the white line by clicking the guess button.
